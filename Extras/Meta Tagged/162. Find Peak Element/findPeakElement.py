# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

 

# Constraints:

#     1 <= nums.length <= 1000
#     -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
#     nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

        while l < r:
            mid = l + ((r - l)) // 2

            if nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
                l = mid + 1

                r = mid

class Solution:
    def findPeakGrid(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]: #Time-Complexity: O(log(m) * n
                                                               #Space-Complexity: O(1)
        
        #Approach: You can think of this problem in two ways! Either column-based or row-based! 
        
        #Idea is that we perform binary search on mat grid and utilize search space on rows. ROW BASED
        #for the current middle row we are on, find the maximum element, as it will be bigger than
        #both of its left and right neighboring elements. To verify this element is a peak, we need
        #to make sure that it is also bigger than the immediate top and bottom neighboring elements!
        
        #however, we need to be careful of the bottom and top neighboring elements being out of bounds!
        #in this case, the current peak candidate will always be bigger than such elements since
        #all elements within mat are guaranteed to be positive numbers!
        #Right when we find peak element, we should return its position immediately!
        
        #define my search space by row!

            max_pos = None
            max_val = float(-inf)
            #iterate linearly through the row since it's not sorted and find the maximum element as well
            #as its position!
            for j in range(len(mid_row)):
                if(mid_row[j] > max_val):

                    max_pos = j
                    continue
            #once we have max_pos, then we have to compare relative to top and bottom neighbors!
            top_val = -1 if mid - 1 < 0 else mat[mid-1][max_pos]
            bottom_val = -1 if mid + 1 >= len(mat) else mat[mid+1][max_pos]
            #then it's a peak!

                return [mid, max_pos]
